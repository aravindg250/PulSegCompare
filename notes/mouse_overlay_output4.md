## Notes

* Used:
    * Full Shift up and to the right
* Result
    * still off on the right and up
* TODO on `mouse_overlay_output5.tif`
    * I think I had been using the wrong file the whole time
    * After running TubeMap on the 40um image, I realized both the post 
    processed file is the same file size as my segmentation
    * Which makes sense since that the actual size of the file
    * I should have been using the 40um, but I was using the 10um
    * I added the 40um file ot inputs so Ill run that through and now it should be accurately overlayed
