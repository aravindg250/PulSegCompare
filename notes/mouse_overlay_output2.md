## Notes

* Used:
    * Half left shift and half top shift to try to center it
* Result
    * Needs to move up and right
    * mainly to the right
* TODO on `mouse_overlay_output3.tif`
    * Shift it completely to the left by using a full left
    * Keep the half top shift as before and hopefully that does something
